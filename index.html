               <b > Morocco</b> <i>is attracting an ever-increasing number of visitors and often appears at the top of the rankings of the best
                holiday destinations for its hospitality, landscapes and culture. For several years now, Moroccan cuisine has been
                another facet of the Kingdom that has continued to gain in acclaim and rewards. Indeed, Moroccan gastronomy is at the
                top of the rankings of the world’s best cuisines. Moroccan cuisine seduces with its spices, flavours and multiple
                influences (Arabic, Andalusian, Berber, etc.). It is renowned for both its street-food with the famous stands on Place
                Jemaâ-El-Fna in the evening, as well as its starred gourmet cuisine with renowned chefs.</i>

            <h3 style="color: maroon;">Moroccan cuisine, a precious heritage</h3>
            <pre> 
                The richness of <mark> Moroccan cuisine </mark> stems from the respect for certain ancestral know-how that has been passed down by
                families for generations. This domain is generally reserved for women. But it is opening up to men. Indeed, Moroccan
                cuisine is not frozen in time. It is alive and evolving over time while preserving the skills and techniques learned
                from its ancestors. Everyone adds their own personal touch to a dish and thus contributes to the influence of Moroccan
                gastronomy.
