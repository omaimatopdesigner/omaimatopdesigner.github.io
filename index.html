            <h3 style="color: maroon;">Moroccan cuisine, a precious heritage</h3>
            <pre> 
                The richness of <mark> Moroccan cuisine </mark> stems from the respect for certain ancestral know-how that has been passed down by
                families for generations. This domain is generally reserved for women. But it is opening up to men. Indeed, Moroccan
                cuisine is not frozen in time. It is alive and evolving over time while preserving the skills and techniques learned
                from its ancestors. Everyone adds their own personal touch to a dish and thus contributes to the influence of Moroccan
                gastronomy.
